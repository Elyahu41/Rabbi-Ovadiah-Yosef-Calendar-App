# Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Calendar App
The goal of this app is to recreate the Ohr HaChaim calendar that is widespread in Israel:

In order to create this app, I needed an API that would give me the times for sunrise and sunset everyday. I was recommended the well known [KosherJava](https://github.com/KosherJava/zmanim) Package, and that is the basis for this app's zmanim (time) calculations.

The app can display the zmanim/times in hebrew and english.

The only zman/time that could not be computed by the KosherJava API is the sunrise time that the Ohr HaChayim calendar uses. They explain in the calendar introduction that they take the sunrise times from a calendar called, "Luach Bechoray Yosef". I found out that the creator of this calendar made a website (chaitables.com) to help people use his algorithm for sunrise all over the world. Therefore, I added the ability to download these times in the app. (Please see the introduction on chaitables.com to understand why it is so hard to compute the sunrise times.)
