# Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Calendar App
This is a passion project that I created while in college.
The goal was to create an android app that would be able to calculate the zmanim/times for the day according to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ZT"L.
I essentially wanted to recreate this calendar that is widespread in Israel:

In order to create this app, I needed an API that would give me the times for sunrise and sunset everyday. I was recommended the KosherJava API, and that is the basis for this app's zmanim (time) calculations.

The only zman/time that could not be computed by the KosherJava API is the sunrise time that the Ohr HaChayim calendar uses. They explain in the calendar introduction that they take the sunrise times from a calendar called, "Luach Bechoray Yosef". I found out that the creator of the calendar made a website to help people use his algorithm for sunrise all over the world. Therefore, I added the ability to download these times in the app.
