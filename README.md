# Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Calendar App
This is a passion project that I created while in college.
The goal was to create an android app that would be able to calculate the zmanim/times for the day according to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ZT"L.
I essentially wanted to recreate this calendar that is widespread in Israel:

In order to create this app, I needed an API that would give me the times for sunrise and sunset everyday. I was recommended the KosherJava API, and that is the basis for this app's zmanim (time) calculations.

Included in the app, is the ability to add elevation data to the sunrise and sunset times, and in order to find out the relevant elevation data of the current city, I found a website called chaitables.com
that gathered this information for each city. In the app, you can choose to navigate to the website and find your city's elevation data.
